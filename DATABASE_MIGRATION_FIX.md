# 🚨 Database Migration Issue - FIXED ✅

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

**Error**: `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable: relation "stock_alerts" does not exist`

**Root Cause**: The database migrations haven't been run on your Railway deployment, so the `stock_alerts` table (and potentially other tables) don't exist in the database.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Updated Dockerfile.railway**
- ✅ Added database migration step before application startup
- ✅ Added `curl` for health checks
- ✅ Created startup script that runs migrations first

### 2. **Updated Dockerfile**
- ✅ Added database migration step for consistency
- ✅ Added `postgresql-client` for database operations

### 3. **Updated start.sh**
- ✅ Added migration step with error handling
- ✅ Continues startup even if migrations fail (with warning)

### 4. **Created Migration Script**
- ✅ `run_migrations.py` - Standalone migration script
- ✅ Includes database connection testing
- ✅ Provides detailed error reporting

## 🚀 **How to Fix Your Railway Deployment**

### **Option 1: Automatic Fix (Recommended)**
The updated Dockerfiles will automatically run migrations on the next deployment:

1. **Commit and push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix database migration issue - add migration steps to deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically redeploy** with the new Dockerfile that includes migration steps.

### **Option 2: Manual Migration (If needed)**
If you need to run migrations immediately:

1. **Access your Railway service** via the Railway dashboard
2. **Open the terminal** in your Railway service
3. **Run the migration script**:
   ```bash
   cd /app
   python run_migrations.py
   ```

### **Option 3: Local Testing**
To test migrations locally:

```bash
cd backend
python run_migrations.py
```

## 📋 **What the Fix Does**

### **Before (Broken)**:
```dockerfile
# ❌ No migration step
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### **After (Fixed)**:
```dockerfile
# ✅ Runs migrations before starting app
RUN echo '#!/bin/bash\n\
echo "Running database migrations..."\n\
alembic upgrade head\n\
echo "Starting FastAPI application..."\n\
exec uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000' > /app/start.sh && chmod +x /app/start.sh

CMD ["/app/start.sh"]
```

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Check Migration Status**
After deployment, verify migrations ran successfully:

```bash
# In Railway terminal
alembic current
alembic history
```

### **2. Check Database Tables**
Verify the `stock_alerts` table exists:

```sql
-- In your database
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'stock_alerts';
```

### **3. Test API Endpoints**
Check if stock alerts endpoints work:

```bash
curl https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/v1/stock-alerts
```

## 📊 **Migration Files Included**

The following migration files will be applied:

1. **`1ae83dadffbd_initial_migration_with_all_models.py`**
   - Creates all base tables including `stock_alerts`
   - Sets up foreign key relationships
   - Establishes indexes

2. **`3cbaf9ab57b9_add_is_active_to_categories.py`**
   - Adds `is_active` field to categories

3. **`b8c47f5a2e23_add_user_roles_and_permissions.py`**
   - Adds user roles and permissions

## 🛡️ **Error Handling**

The updated deployment process includes:

- ✅ **Graceful migration failures** - App continues even if migrations fail
- ✅ **Database connection testing** - Verifies database is accessible
- ✅ **Detailed error reporting** - Shows exactly what went wrong
- ✅ **Retry logic** - Multiple attempts for transient failures

## 🎉 **Expected Outcome**

After the fix is deployed:

1. ✅ **Database tables created** - All tables including `stock_alerts` will exist
2. ✅ **API endpoints working** - Stock alerts and other features will function
3. ✅ **No more errors** - The `UndefinedTable` error will be resolved
4. ✅ **Automatic migrations** - Future deployments will include migrations

## 📞 **If Issues Persist**

If you still encounter issues after deployment:

1. **Check Railway logs** for migration errors
2. **Verify DATABASE_URL** environment variable is set correctly
3. **Run manual migration** using the provided script
4. **Contact support** with specific error messages
